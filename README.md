# Tara_Opsins
An Ocean of Opsins dataset


Figure S1 Bioinformatic pipeline was adopted to efficiently mine, cluster, and annotate opsins from TARA metaT (MATOU) and metaG (SMAGs) to be used for the phylogenetic analyses.

Figure S2 Phylogenetic analysis computed using all the 2091 sequences from TARA and an already annotated dataset of 567 reference sequences (i.e. Dataset 1). 

Figure S3 
Phylogenetic analysis computed using all the sequences attributed to arthropods’ r-opsin from Tara and an already annotated dataset containing metazoa r-opsins from Fleming et al. (2021) (i.e. Dataset 2).


Figure S4 Phylogenetic analysis computed using sequences from TARA where 95% of arthropod sequences were randomly subsampled (only 5% retained) and an already annotated dataset of 567 reference sequences (i.e. Dataset 2).

File S1
Alignment containing all the 2091 sequences from Tara and an already annotated dataset of 738 reference sequences (Dataset 1).

File S2
Alignment containing all the sequences attributed to arthropods’ r-opsin from Tara and an already annotated dataset containing metazoa r-opsins from Fleming et al. (2021) (i.e. Dataset 2).

File S3

File S4
Tables containing original taxonomic information and sampling data of the sequences from the original Tara dataset.

File S5
Table containing the sequence collected from SMAGs dataset and it’s respective SMAG.

File S6
