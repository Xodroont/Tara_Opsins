# Tara_Opsins
An Ocean of Opsins dataset


Figure S1 Bioinformatic pipeline was adopted to efficiently mine, cluster, and annotate opsins from TARA metaT (MATOU) and metaG (SMAGs) to be used for the phylogenetic analyses.

Figure S2 Phylogenetic analysis computed using all the 2093 sequences from TARA and an already annotated dataset of 567 reference sequences (i.e. Dataset 1). 

Figure S3 Phylogenetic analysis computed using sequences from TARA where 95% of arthropod sequences were randomly subsampled (only 5% retained) and an already annotated dataset of 567 reference sequences (i.e. Dataset 2).

File S1 Alignment containing all the 2093 sequences from TARA and an already annotated dataset of 567 reference sequences (Dataset 1). 

File S2 Alignment containing sequences from TARA where arthropod sequences were 274 subsamples (only 5% retained) and an already annotated dataset of 567 reference 275 sequences (Dataset 2).
