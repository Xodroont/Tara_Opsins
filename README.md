# Tara_Opsins
An Ocean of Opsins dataset


Figure S1 Bioinformatic pipeline was adopted to efficiently mine, cluster, and annotate opsins from TARA metaT (MATOU) and metaG (SMAGs) to be used for the phylogenetic analyses.

Figure S2 Phylogenetic analysis computed using all the 2091 sequences from TARA and an already annotated dataset of 567 reference sequences (i.e. Dataset 1). 

Figure S3 
Phylogenetic analysis computed using all the sequences attributed to arthropods’ r-opsin from Tara and an already annotated dataset containing metazoa r-opsins from Fleming et al. (2021) (i.e. Dataset 2).

Figure S4 Opsin taxonomical distribution in arthropods using SMAGs annotations. (A) A plot showing the estimated number of opsin genes in Tara per taxonomical group. (B) Distribution of opsin subfamilies in TARA within different taxonomical groups. (C) Distribution of visual opsin (r-opsin) in TARA within arthropods and their phylogenetic relationship (D). Numbers indicate the percentage of assembled opsin sequences. Color code in A: Malacostracans in green, Hexanauplia in light blue, Brachiopoda in sapphire, other Arthropods in grey. In D, stars indicate UFB>95, squares UFB>75, and triangles UFB<50. Animal silhouettes from Phylopic. 

Figure S5 Phylogenetic analysis computed using sequences from TARA where 95% of arthropod sequences were randomly subsampled (only 5% retained) and an already annotated dataset of 567 reference sequences (i.e. Dataset 2).
